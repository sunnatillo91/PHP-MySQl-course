//Functions
    
//  A function is a block of code written in a program to perform some specific task
    
// Two major types of functions:
    //Built-in function
    //User-defined function

//Why should we use functions?
    //1. Reusability
    //2. Easy for error detection
    //3. Easily maintained
    
//Functions name could be like below:
    
//Camel case
    //Every word after the one is a capital
    //my_Function();

//Lower case
    //All lowercase, underscore inbetween 
    //my-function();
    
//Pascal case
    //Every word is capitalized
    //MyFunction();
    
function myFunction() {
    $x = "Hello!";
    echo $x;
}
myFunction();
echo $x;
    
?>
